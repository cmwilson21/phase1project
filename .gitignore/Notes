EVENTUALLY
I would also like for the page to display a small selection of random quotes from the book. Here are the quotes -
“The bards sing of love, they celebrate slaughter, they extol kings and flatter queens, but were I a poet I would write in praise of friendship.” From TWK

“Ferocity gave her a beauty that nature had denied her.” From TWK

“Dreams are like songs. Their task is not to offer an exact image of the world, but a suggestion of it.” From EXC 

“She is a woman, and what women want, they get, and if the world and all it holds must be broken in the getting, then so be it.” From EXC 

"But if we abandon oaths then we abandon guidance. We fall into chaos. We just fall. We become no better than beasts.” From EOG
