I would also like for the page to display a small selection of random quotes from the book. Here are the quotes -
“The bards sing of love, they celebrate slaughter, they extol kings and flatter queens, but were I a poet I would write in praise of friendship.” From TWK

“Ferocity gave her a beauty that nature had denied her.” From TWK

“Dreams are like songs. Their task is not to offer an exact image of the world, but a suggestion of it.” From EXC 

“She is a woman, and what women want, they get, and if the world and all it holds must be broken in the getting, then so be it.” From EXC
